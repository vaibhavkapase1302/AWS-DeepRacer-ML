# ML:
What is machine learning?
Common techniques in machine learning:
1) Supervised learning
2) Unsupervised learning
3) Reinforcement learning

Machine learning (ML) is a modern software development technique, and a type of artificial intelligence (AI), that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data. 

It allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.

## Nearly all tasks solved with machine learning involve three primary components:
- A machine learning model
- A model training algorithm
- A model inference algorithm

## Model training
In the preceding section, we talked about two key pieces of information: a model and data. In this section, we show you how those two pieces of information are used to create a trained model. This process is called model training.

Clustering: Clustering is an unsupervised learning task that helps to determine if there are any naturally occurring groupings in the data.
