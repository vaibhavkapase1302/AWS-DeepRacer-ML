# ML:
What is machine learning?
Common techniques in machine learning:
1) Supervised learning
2) Unsupervised learning
3) Reinforcement learning

Machine learning (ML) is a modern software development technique, and a type of artificial intelligence (AI), that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data. 

It allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.

## Nearly all tasks solved with machine learning involve three primary components:
- A machine learning model
- A model training algorithm
- A model inference algorithm
