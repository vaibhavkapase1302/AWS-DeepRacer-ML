# ML:
What is machine learning?
Common techniques in machine learning:
1) Supervised learning: Labeled Data
2) Unsupervised learning: Unlabeled Data
3) Reinforcement learning

Machine learning (ML) is a modern software development technique, and a type of artificial intelligence (AI), that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data. 

It allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.

## Nearly all tasks solved with machine learning involve three primary components:
- A machine learning model
- A model training algorithm
- A model inference algorithm

## Model training
In the preceding section, we talked about two key pieces of information: a model and data. In this section, we show you how those two pieces of information are used to create a trained model. This process is called model training.

Clustering: Clustering is an unsupervised learning task that helps to determine if there are any naturally occurring groupings in the data.

Labeled Data

Unlabled data

## The Four Aspects of Working with Data

To build a good dataset, there are four key aspects to be considered when working with your data. First, you need to collect the data. Second, you should inspect your data to check for outliers, missing or incomplete values, and to see if any kind of data reformatting is required. Third, you should use summary statistics to understand the scope, scale, and shape of the dataset. Finally, you should use data visualizations to check for outliers, and to see trends in your data.

Impute: 
Impute is a common term referring to different statistical tools that can be used to calculate missing values from your dataset.

Outliers:
Outliers  are data points that are significantly different from other date in the same sample.
